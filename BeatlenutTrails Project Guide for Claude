BeatlenutTrails Project Guide for Claude Maxx Agent
This comprehensive guide enables the Claude Maxx AI agent to initiate and develop the BeatlenutTrails website and Ex-Servicemen (ESM) marketplace using React with Tailwind CSS, as specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and informed by our conversation. It incorporates design elements from two reference images (screenshots of travel-related websites: Vaani Greens’ booking interface and Vaanam Orchids’ retreat page), leverages existing templates (TripFinder for the travel website and Martfury for the ESM marketplace), and ensures a cohesive design system. The guide covers project setup, feature implementation, and next steps, all executable from the terminal.
1. Project Overview
The BeatlenutTrails project aims to create:

Travel Website: A platform to promote curated travel experiences in Northeast India, with pages including Homepage, About Us, Services, Destinations, Packages, Reels Showcase, Blog, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Search Results.
ESM Marketplace: A platform for Ex-Servicemen to register, create profiles, list products or services, and communicate via messaging, accessible at /esm-portal.
Admin Panel: A backend interface for managing content, users, inquiries, and ESM listings (to be developed later).
Goals:
Drive inquiries and bookings for travel services.
Establish an authentic online presence reflecting Northeast India’s beauty.
Support Ex-Servicemen through a functional marketplace.


Target Audience:
Adventure seekers, culture enthusiasts, nature lovers (25-65 years).

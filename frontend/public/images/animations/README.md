# Animation Assets

This directory should contain animation assets for the website.

## Required Files:

- `truck.png` - A side profile of a truck or transportation vehicle for the TruckSection animation
  - This should be a transparent PNG with a clean silhouette
  - Recommended dimensions: approximately 600px wide by 300px tall
  - This file is used in the TruckAnimation component

## Implementation Note

For production use, you'll need to add the actual truck.png file here. This should be a clean, 
professional image of a vehicle relevant to your tourism business, with a transparent background.

If you don't have the dadson-website truck.png, consider creating or purchasing a suitable replacement
that matches your brand identity.

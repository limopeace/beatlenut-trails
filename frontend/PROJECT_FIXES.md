# Project Structure Fixes

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files

1. **package.json**
   - Removed "type": "module" to avoid ES module conflicts with CommonJS dependencies
   - This ensures compatibility with the Next.js build system

2. **next.config.js**
   - Changed to CommonJS format using module.exports
   - Added swcMinify for better optimization

3. **tailwind.config.js**
   - Switched to CommonJS format
   - Expanded content paths to ensure all component files are scanned
   - Removed font family definitions from Tailwind config to avoid conflicts

4. **postcss.config.js**
   - Changed to CommonJS format for consistency

### 2. Font Implementation

1. **Simplified Font Management**
   - Using Google Fonts with Next.js font optimization
   - Defined fonts in layout.tsx and applied via CSS variables
   - Using Outfit as the heading font and Space Grotesk as the body font

2. **CSS Structure**
   - Updated globals.css with more direct CSS styling
   - Set font variables in :root for global access
   - Defined base styles for typography and components
   - Added responsive adjustments for better mobile experience

3. **Component Updates**
   - Simplified all components to use Tailwind classes directly
   - Removed inline style approach for fonts in favor of global CSS

### 3. MarqueeText Component

- Simplified implementation for better performance
- Using basic Framer Motion animation
- Text formatting logic for consistent appearance

## How These Changes Fix Previous Issues

1. **Configuration Compatibility**
   - All configuration files now use the same module format
   - This prevents module resolution errors during build

2. **CSS Processing**
   - Direct CSS approach avoids Tailwind utility class generation issues
   - CSS variables for fonts ensure consistency across components

3. **Component Stability**
   - Simplified components rely less on custom configurations
   - More robust against build system quirks

## Next Steps

1. Test the application running with these changes
2. No additional files need to be downloaded or installed
3. Everything should work out of the box with the standard Next.js and Tailwind setup

This approach uses standard patterns and avoids the complex configurations that were causing issues.

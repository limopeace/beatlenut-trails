# Image Loading Fixes

## Changes Made to Fix Image Loading Issues

We've simplified the image loading approach to ensure images display correctly:

### 1. Removed Complex Image Components

- Eliminated the custom NextImage component with all its extra functionality
- Removed ContentPlaceholder, CreatePlaceholderImage, and other helpers
- Simplified the approach to use Next.js Image component directly

### 2. Updated Next.js Config

- Removed `unoptimized: true` which was causing issues
- Kept only essential configuration

### 3. Simplified Component Implementations

- Updated Hero component to use basic Image component
- Updated FeaturedDestinations to use direct Image components
- Updated FeaturedServices to use direct Image components

### 4. Removed Dependencies on Animation Libraries

- Removed dependencies on animation in image loading
- Simplified the loading process

## Testing

The images should now load correctly with this simplified approach. If there are still issues:

1. Check if the image files exist in the public folder
2. Verify image paths are correct
3. Ensure Next.js is properly configured

## Why This Works

The simplified approach ensures:

1. No interference from complex state management
2. Direct usage of Next.js built-in Image component
3. Fewer points of failure in the image loading pipeline

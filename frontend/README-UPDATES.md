# BeatlenutTrails Frontend - Updated Implementation

## Recent Updates

The frontend has been updated with a new streamlined design featuring:

1. Clean, consistent UI with the new color palette:
   - Primary: #609966
   - Secondary: #9DC08B
   - Light: #EDF1D6
   - Dark: #40513B

2. Improved layout structure with:
   - Proper spacing between sections
   - Consistent card heights
   - Fixed navigation issues

3. Enhanced visual elements:
   - Standardized button styles
   - Consistent text alignment
   - Improved responsive design

## Getting Started

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Next.js development server on port 3000.

## Docker Support

You can also run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build and start the Docker container
./docker-start.sh
```

This will build a Docker image and run it on port 3000.

## Implementation Notes

### Removed Alternative Home Pages

The following alternative home page implementations have been removed to streamline development:

- alternative
- enhanced
- revised
- northeast
- streamlined
- streamlined-fixed

These have been backed up to the `temp/removed_pages` directory.

### CSS Implementation

The application now uses:

1. A dedicated CSS file for the home page styles (`src/styles/home.css`)
2. Clean React component structure
3. Improved responsive design for all screen sizes

### Known Issues

If you encounter the error "Invariant: missing bootstrap script", try the following:

1. Clear the `.next` cache directory: `rm -rf .next`
2. Restart the development server: `npm run dev`

Or use the Docker implementation which has consistent builds.

# Bike Animation Restoration

This document outlines the changes made to restore and enhance the motorcycle animation on the homepage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Replacement and Positioning
- Replaced `BikeRentals` component with `BikeRentalsSection` component in the homepage
- Moved the bike section below the services section for better page flow
- Added proper full-width container with background color to prevent display issues
- The BikeRentalsSection provides a more structured layout with better animation integration

### 2. Enhanced Motorcycle Animation
- Improved the animation parameters in `MotorcycleAnimation.tsx`:
  - Changed from spring physics to smoother tween animation to prevent jerky motion
  - Reduced rotation from -5 to -2 degrees to make the tilt less dramatic
  - Used easeInOut easing for smoother motion throughout the animation
  - Reduced scale amount from 1.05 to 1.02 for more subtle sizing
  - Optimized animation duration to 1.5s for better pacing
  - Set final position at x: 100px for better visual balance
  - Positioned the motorcycle higher in its container (moved to top: 30px)

### 3. Layout and Background Fixes
- Restructured the BikeRentalsSection component to give more prominence to the motorcycle animation:
  - Added a dedicated hero section with a two-column layout
  - Made the animation full-height on desktop
  - Ensured responsive behavior on mobile devices
  - Added direct call-to-action buttons under the main header
  - Used transparent PNG image for better visual integration
  - Fixed the background display issues with proper structure:
    - Used proper absolute positioning instead of fixed to prevent conflicts
    - Added multiple stacked background layers for complete coverage
    - Added an extra background element to ensure full viewport width
    - Set explicit width on the section container to prevent content clipping
  - Implemented an extremely dark overlay with near-opaque black (98% opacity)
  - Added multiple layered effects: base overlay, gradient, and texture pattern
  - Set a dark fallback background color in case the image doesn't load
  - Updated text colors to white for better readability
  - Removed bike listing grid and premium services sections for a cleaner display

### 4. Animation Trigger
- Maintained the Intersection Observer trigger for the animation
- Animation now plays when the section comes into view
- The motorcycle "swoops in" from the left side with a slight rotation and scale effect

## Component Structure
The animation effect is created through the collaboration of three key components:

1. **MotorcycleAnimation Component** - Handles the motion animation using Framer Motion
2. **BikeRentalsSection Component** - Integrates the animation in the page layout
3. **HomePage Component** - Renders the BikeRentalsSection in the correct position

## Technical Implementation
The animation uses Framer Motion with the following properties:
- Initial state: x=-500, opacity=0, scale=0.95, rotate=-2
- Animated state: x=100, opacity=1, scale=1.02, rotate=0
- Tween animation type with easeInOut easing
- 1.5 second duration for the entrance animation
- Triggered by Intersection Observer when the section comes into view
- Properly wrapped in container divs to ensure full-width display

## Future Enhancements
Potential further improvements to consider:
1. Add alternative motorcycle images for different bike types
2. Implement subtle continuous motion (floating effect) after the initial animation
3. Add particle effects (dust/wind) behind the motorcycle
4. Incorporate sound effects on user interaction

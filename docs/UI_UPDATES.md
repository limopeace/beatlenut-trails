## Feature Display Simplification

### Changes Made

1. **Moved feature content**:
   - Transferred the 6 key features from "Why Choose Beatlenut Trails" section to the About Us section
   - Simplified the display to show just icons and titles without the tile containers and descriptions
   - Arranged features in a 2x3 grid layout (3x2 on desktop)

2. **Improved styling**:
   - Added a section title "Why Choose Beatlenut Trails:"
   - Enhanced icon display with subtle borders
   - Added hover effects (slight movement and background color change)
   - Used the Clash font for consistent branding
   - Sized appropriately for mobile and desktop views

3. **Removed redundant section**:
   - Eliminated the large "Why Choose Beatlenut Trails" grid section
   - Created a more streamlined page flow
   - Reduced scrolling required to view all content

### Benefits

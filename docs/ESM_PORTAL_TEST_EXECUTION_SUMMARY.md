2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add monitoring and logging
4. Prepare for production deployment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. API connectivity issues blocking all functionality
2. No error recovery mechanisms
3. Missing form validations

### Medium Risk
1. Performance under load unknown
2. Security headers not configured
3. No monitoring in place

### Low Risk
1. UI/UX improvements needed
2. Additional test coverage
3. Documentation updates

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Testing framework established
✅ Critical issues identified
✅ Improvements implemented
✅ Documentation created
✅ Independence verified

## Success Criteria Pending

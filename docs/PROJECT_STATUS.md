   - Sellers Management page now uses `/api/admin/sellers`
   - Approvals page connected to `/api/approvals` endpoints
   - Admin Dashboard integrated with real statistics API
   - Replaced all mock data with actual API responses

2. **Enhanced API Services**:
   - Created `dashboardService.ts` for dashboard statistics
   - Created `orderService.ts` for order management
   - All services use adminApiClient with JWT authentication
   - Proper error handling and retry logic

3. **UI Components for Better UX**:

## Remaining Tasks

1. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Complete loading states implementation
   - Add error boundaries for better error handling
   - Implement skeleton screens for better UX

2. **Testing**:
   - Complete API connectivity tests
   - Add integration tests for new endpoints
   - Test form validation thoroughly

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Environment configuration
   - Database optimization
   - Performance monitoring setup

## Implementation Notes

### ESM Marketplace Architecture
- **Model Layer**: Mongoose schemas define the data structure with validation
- **Repository Layer**: Encapsulates database operations and handles data access logic
- **Service Layer**: Implements business rules and workflow logic
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Validation Layer**: Uses Joi for request validation before processing

### Frontend Structure
- **Common Components**: Reusable UI elements like Button, Card, SectionTitle
- **Layout Components**: Page structure elements like Header and Footer
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components for travel and marketplace features

## Development Environment

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the application with `npm run dev`

### Key Commands
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with auto-restart
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint code quality checks

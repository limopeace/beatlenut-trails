# Bike Section and Header Navigation Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the bike rental section on the homepage and fixes for the non-working navigation buttons in the header.

## Bike Rental Section Changes

### Layout and Position Changes
1. **Swapped Content Order**
   - Moved the motorcycle animation from right to left side
   - Moved text content from left to right side
   - Updated order classes for proper mobile responsiveness

2. **Motorcycle Animation**
   - Raised the motorcycle by 100px (changed from top: '30px' to top: '-70px')
   - Reversed animation direction to animate from right to left
   - Updated initial state and animation parameters to match new direction

3. **Visual Improvements**
   - Darkened background from gray-900 to gray-950 (~30% darker)
   - Reduced background image opacity from 25% to 20% 
   - Updated gradient overlay to match darker background
   - Updated background in page.tsx container to match component

## Header Navigation Fixes

### Desktop Navigation
- Replaced non-working Link components with button elements for section navigation
- Removed preventDefault() calls that were blocking click events
- Maintained direct Link elements for actual page navigation (/bike-rentals, /contact, etc.)
- Preserved visual styling to maintain consistency

### Mobile Navigation
- Similar fixes applied to mobile menu navigation
- Added text-left and w-full classes to ensure proper button alignment
- Maintained mobile menu closing functionality
- Preserved visual styling for consistency

## Animation Direction Changes

The motorcycle animation was updated to match the new layout:

### Previous Animation (Left to Right)
```javascript
// Initial state
initial={{ x: -500, opacity: 0, scale: 0.95, rotate: -2 }}

// Animation
controls.start({
  x: 100, 
  opacity: 1,
  scale: 1.02,
  rotate: 0,
  // ...
});
```

### Updated Animation (Right to Left)
```javascript
// Initial state
initial={{ x: 500, opacity: 0, scale: 0.95, rotate: 2 }}

// Animation
controls.start({
  x: -100, 
  opacity: 1,
  scale: 1.02,
  rotate: 0,
  // ...
});
```

## Benefits

These changes offer several improvements to the site:

1. **Enhanced Visual Balance**: The swapped layout provides better visual weight distribution
2. **Improved User Flow**: The darker background creates better visual separation between sections
3. **Working Navigation**: All navigation buttons now properly scroll to their target sections
4. **Better Animation**: The adjusted motorcycle animation matches the new layout direction
5. **Improved Mobile Experience**: All changes maintain responsive design for smaller screens

## Technical Implementation Notes

The implementation involved changes to:
- BikeRentalsSection.tsx
- MotorcycleAnimation.tsx
- Header.tsx
- page.tsx

We replaced anchor tags with proper button elements for same-page navigation, which is a more semantically correct approach and resolves the non-working navigation issues.
